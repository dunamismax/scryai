This is your first starter post.

Use it as a sanity check after setup:

- The post appears on the homepage.
- Search can find this text after `bun run build`.
- RSS includes this entry.
- Dynamic OG image generation works for this route.

From here, replace this file with your own writing voice and publishing cadence.
