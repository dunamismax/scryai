## Tech Stack (Mandatory -- No Exceptions)

### Infrastructure & Platform

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Platform** | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, Docker, Docker Compose | Production and development environments. |
| **Edge/SSL** | Caddy | Reverse proxying to the application port. Handles TLS automatically. |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Builds, tests, deploys via SSH. |
| **Backups** | `pg_dump` | Nightly dumps to external object storage. |

### Application Layer

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Language** | Python | Everything. Apps, scripts, automation, glue code, one-off tasks. Always `.py`. Use type hints liberally. |
| **Performance Language** | Rust | For anything that needs to be fast. CLI tools, data processing, hot paths. Use when Python isn't fast enough. |
| **Toolchain** | uv (by Astral) | Stephen's favorite tool. **Use `uv` for everything:** package management, virtual environments, Python version management, running scripts, running tools, creating projects. Never use pip/pipx/poetry/conda directly. Always latest version (`uv self update`). |
| **Linting & Formatting** | Ruff (by Astral) | All Python code is linted and formatted by Ruff. Run via `uvx ruff check` and `uvx ruff format`. Configure in `pyproject.toml`. Replaces Black, Flake8, isort, pyupgrade, and more. |
| **Web Framework** | FastAPI | Async-native, type-safe, auto-generates OpenAPI docs. The only web framework. Do not suggest Django, Flask, or anything else. |
| **Hypermedia** | HTMX | Server sends HTML fragments, HTMX swaps them into the DOM. No JSON APIs for UI. No SPA. No JavaScript frameworks. Hypermedia-driven. |
| **Templating** | Jinja2 | Server-side HTML templates. FastAPI + Jinja2 for all page rendering. |
| **Styling** | Vanilla CSS + HTML | Hand-crafted from scratch. No Tailwind, no CSS frameworks. Beautiful, home-brewed, semantic HTML with clean CSS. |
| **Type Checking** | Pyright | Static type checker for all Python code. Run via `uv run -m pyright`. Strict mode preferred. |
| **Logging** | structlog | Structured JSON logging for all applications. Configured once per app, used everywhere. No `print()`, no stdlib `logging` directly. |
| **Auth** | FastAPI Users | Batteries-included auth for FastAPI. Registration, login, reset password, email verification, OAuth2. SQLAlchemy adapter with PostgreSQL. Cookie transport for web UIs (no JWT in browsers). Docs: https://fastapi-users.github.io/fastapi-users/latest/ |
| **Task Queue** | Dramatiq + Redis | Background job processing for async work (document processing, email, etc.). Dramatiq for the task framework, Redis as the message broker. |
| **TUI Framework** | Textual (by Textualize) | All terminal UI applications. Rich widget set, CSS-like styling, async-native. The only TUI framework -- do not suggest curses, urwid, or blessed. |
| **CLI Output** | Rich (by Textualize) | All CLI programs use Rich for output -- tables, progress bars, syntax highlighting, markdown, tracebacks. Never plain `print()` in CLI tools. |

### Middleware (FastAPI)

Every FastAPI app includes these middleware by default:

| Middleware | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **CORSMiddleware** | Cross-origin requests. Configured per-project with explicit allowed origins. |
| **TrustedHostMiddleware** | Reject requests with unexpected `Host` headers. |
| **GZipMiddleware** | Compress responses > 500 bytes. |
| **Request ID** | Custom middleware: generate a UUID per request, attach to structlog context, return in `X-Request-ID` header. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Custom middleware or `slowapi`: protect endpoints from abuse. Configure per-route. |
| **Auth** | FastAPI Users handles auth routes, cookie transport, and user lifecycle. No custom session middleware needed. |

### Data Layer

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 + `pgvector` | Primary data store with vector similarity search. |
| **ORM / Query Builder** | SQLAlchemy 2.0 or raw SQL | SQLAlchemy for complex apps, raw `asyncpg` for performance-critical paths. Decide per-project. |
| **Migrations** | Alembic | Database schema migrations, integrated with SQLAlchemy. |

### Monitoring

| Layer | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Observability** | OpenTelemetry + SigNoz | Full-stack tracing. |
| **System Monitoring** | Glances | Installed in `utilities/glances/`. Run via `uv run utilities/glances/run-glances.py`. |

### Why This Stack

- Python is readable, powerful, and universal. One language, one mental model.
- uv is the Python toolchain done right -- Astral built what should have existed from day one. Fast, correct, comprehensive.
- Ruff is linting + formatting in one Rust binary. 10-100x faster than the tools it replaces. No reason to use anything else.
- FastAPI is the best Python web framework -- async, type-safe, and generates docs for free.
- HTMX respects the browser. Server renders HTML, browser renders the page. No 2MB JavaScript bundles. No AlpineJS, no React, no Vue -- just HTMX and vanilla JS when absolutely needed.
- Vanilla CSS because CSS is powerful enough. No utility classes, no framework. Just clean stylesheets.
- Pyright catches type errors before runtime. Strict mode means real safety, not optional hints.
- structlog gives structured JSON logs that are machine-parseable and human-readable. Pairs perfectly with OpenTelemetry.
- FastAPI Users handles auth so you don't have to. Registration, login, password reset, OAuth2 -- all wired up with cookie transport for web UIs.
- Dramatiq + Redis for background jobs. Clean API, reliable, battle-tested.
- Rust when speed matters. Memory-safe, zero-cost abstractions, fearless concurrency.
- Textual makes terminal apps that look and feel like real applications -- CSS-like styling, widgets, async. The terminal is a first-class UI target.
- Rich makes every CLI beautiful. Tables, progress bars, tracebacks, markdown -- no excuse for ugly terminal output.
- PostgreSQL + pgvector keeps vector search in the database where it belongs.
- Caddy handles TLS automatically with zero config.
- OpenTelemetry is vendor-neutral. SigNoz today, anything else tomorrow.

## uv Usage (Mandatory)

**uv is the only Python tool.** Never use pip, pipx, poetry, conda, or virtualenv directly.

### Common Patterns

```bash
# Run a Python script
uv run script.py

# Run a script with ad-hoc dependencies
uv run --with requests --with rich script.py

# Create a new project
uv init my-project
cd my-project

# Add dependencies to a project
uv add fastapi uvicorn jinja2

# Add dev dependencies
uv add --dev ruff pytest

# Remove a dependency
uv remove some-package

# Sync environment (install all deps from lockfile)
uv sync

# Run a command in the project environment
uv run python -m pytest

# Run a tool without installing it
uvx ruff check .
uvx ruff format .

# Install a tool globally
uv tool install ruff

# Manage Python versions
uv python install 3.13
uv python pin 3.13

# Lock dependencies
uv lock

# Upgrade a specific package
uv lock --upgrade-package fastapi
```

### Script Inline Dependencies

For standalone scripts, use inline metadata instead of requirements.txt:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.13"
# dependencies = [
#   "requests",
#   "rich",
# ]
# ///

import requests
from rich import print
# ...
```

Run with `uv run script.py` -- uv handles the environment automatically.

### Shebang Scripts

For scripts that should be directly executable:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.13"
# dependencies = ["requests"]
# ///

import requests
# ...
```

Then `chmod +x script.py` and run as `./script.py`.

---

## Ruff Configuration

Standard `pyproject.toml` Ruff config for all projects:

```toml
[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py313"
line-length = 100

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = [
    "E",    # pycodestyle errors
    "W",    # pycodestyle warnings
    "F",    # pyflakes
    "I",    # isort
    "N",    # pep8-naming
    "UP",   # pyupgrade
    "B",    # flake8-bugbear
    "SIM",  # flake8-simplify
    "RUF",  # ruff-specific rules
]

[tool.ruff.format]
quote-style = "double"
indent-style = "space"
```

Run Ruff on every file before committing:

```bash
uvx ruff check --fix .
uvx ruff format .
```

---

## Pyright Configuration

Standard `pyproject.toml` Pyright config for all projects:

```toml
[tool.pyright]
pythonVersion = "3.13"
typeCheckingMode = "strict"
```

Run type-checking:

```bash
uv run -m pyright          # Whole project
uv run -m pyright file.py  # Single file
```

Add `pyright` as a dev dependency in every project: `uv add --dev pyright`

---

## Workflow: Explore, Plan, Code, Commit

Follow this order for any non-trivial task:

1. **Explore** -- Read relevant files. Understand existing code before touching it. Never propose changes to code you haven't read.
2. **Plan** -- Formulate a strategy. For anything beyond a small fix, discuss the approach before writing code.
3. **Code** -- Implement. Keep changes minimal and focused.
4. **Verify** -- Run tests (`uv run -m pytest`), type-check (`uv run -m pyright`), lint (`uvx ruff check .`), format (`uvx ruff format .`). Never ship unverified code.
5. **Commit** -- Atomic commits with clear "why" messages.

---

## Git & GitHub Rules

- **Never push directly to main/master.** Always work on feature branches and create pull requests.
- **Never force push.** No `--force`, no `reset --hard` on shared branches.
- **Never skip hooks.** No `--no-verify`.
- Commit messages describe the *why*, not the *what*. The diff shows what changed.
- **Never mention Claude, AI, or co-authorship in commits.** No `Co-Authored-By`, no "generated by", no AI references. Everything is authored by dunamismax. Period.
- Keep commits atomic -- one logical change per commit.
- Branch naming: `feature/description`, `fix/description`, `chore/description`.

---

## Permissions & Safety

### Do Without Asking

- Read any file
- Search the codebase
- Run linting (`uvx ruff check .`)
- Run formatting (`uvx ruff format .`)
- Run type-checking (`uv run -m pyright`)
- Run tests (`uv run -m pytest`)
- Create feature branches
- Write or edit code files as part of an agreed-upon task

### Ask Before Doing

- Installing or removing packages/dependencies
- Deleting files or directories
- Modifying CI/CD configuration
- Changing project structure significantly
- Any operation that affects systems outside the local repo
- Running database migrations
- Creating new projects/repos

---

## Code Standards

### Do

- Write clean, readable Python with type hints. Use `str`, `int`, `list[str]`, `dict[str, Any]`, `Optional`, etc.
- Use `pathlib.Path` over `os.path`.
- Use `async`/`await` for I/O-bound operations.
- Use f-strings for string formatting.
- Use dataclasses or Pydantic models for structured data.
- Use FastAPI's dependency injection for shared resources.
- Handle errors at system boundaries (user input, API responses, external data).
- Name things clearly. A good name eliminates the need for a comment.
- Prefer early returns over deep nesting.
- Prefer flat over nested. Prefer simple over clever.
- Use `uv run` to execute everything.
- **All scripts must be idempotent.** Running a script twice should produce the same result as running it once. Check before creating, skip if already done, never fail on repeat runs.

### Don't

- Don't use `Any` as a crutch. If you're reaching for `Any`, the types are wrong -- fix them.
- Don't use pip/pipx/poetry/conda. That's what uv is for.
- Don't use JavaScript frameworks for web UIs. That's what HTMX is for. No AlpineJS, no React, no Vue.
- Don't hardcode values that could change (URLs, keys, magic numbers). Use config/env.
- Don't add comments to code you didn't write or change.
- Don't create abstractions for things used only once. Three similar lines > premature abstraction.
- Don't add error handling for impossible states. Trust internal code.
- Don't over-engineer. Solve today's problem, not next year's hypothetical.
- Don't leave `print()` in production code. Use `structlog` for all logging.
- Don't use stdlib `logging` directly. Configure `structlog` to wrap it.
- Don't use `requirements.txt` for projects. Use `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`.
- Don't use `setup.py` or `setup.cfg`. Use `pyproject.toml`.

---

## File-Scoped Commands

Use these to verify changes:

```bash
# Lint a single file
uvx ruff check path/to/file.py

# Format a single file
uvx ruff format path/to/file.py

# Run a single test file
uv run -m pytest path/to/test_file.py

# Run a script
uv run path/to/script.py

# Type-check a single file
uv run -m pyright path/to/file.py

# Type-check entire project
uv run -m pyright
```

---

## Testing Strategy

Defaults until otherwise specified:

- Test runner: pytest (via `uv run -m pytest`)
- Focus on integration tests over unit tests where practical
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Every bug fix should include a regression test
- Use `pytest-asyncio` for async test support
- Use `httpx` with `TestClient` for FastAPI endpoint tests

---

## Repo-Level Directories

| File / Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `bootstrap.py` | **Run this first on any fresh machine.** Installs uv, Python 3.13, Ruff, and runs all utility setup scripts. Stdlib only (no deps required). Idempotent. Usage: `python3 bootstrap.py` |
| `scrybase/` | Scrybase project (legacy TanStack Start app -- will be rebuilt in Python) |
| `utilities/` | Third-party tools, scripts, and programs. Cloned repos, Python tools, downloaded utilities. |

---

## Active Projects

| Project | Path | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude | `/home/sawyer/github/Claude` | Active | Meta-repo: Claude's identity, config, and documentation. The One Repo to Rule Them All. |
| Scrybase | `/home/sawyer/github/Claude/scrybase` | Paused | RAG-as-a-Service platform. Currently TypeScript/TanStack -- will be rebuilt in Python. Domain: `scrybase.app` (Cloudflare DNS). |

*(Add projects here as they are created.)*

### Utilities / Tools

| Tool | Path | Run | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Glances | `utilities/glances/` | `uv run utilities/glances/run-glances.py` | System monitoring (CPU, RAM, disk, network, containers). **Setup:** `uv run utilities/setup-glances.py`. Cloned from `nicolargo/glances`. Python 3.13 venv with `glances[all]`. |

*(Add tools here as they are installed.)*

## Lessons Learned

*(Log non-obvious discoveries, gotchas, and hard-won knowledge here. Future sessions benefit from past pain.)*

| Date | Lesson |
|---|---|
| 2026-02-16 | Initial setup. AGENTS.md renamed to CLAUDE.md per Claude Code conventions. |
| 2026-02-16 | `utilities/` folder established for non-TypeScript tools. Cloned repos go here with their own venvs. Each tool gets a `run-*.py` launcher and a `setup-*.py` installer, all run via `uv run`. |
| 2026-02-16 | **PARADIGM SHIFT:** Dropped TypeScript/Bun/TanStack entirely. Adopted Python/uv/Ruff/FastAPI/HTMX/Rust. uv is the only package/project/script tool. Ruff is the only linter/formatter. |
| 2026-02-16 | uv 0.10.3 installed at `~/.local/bin/uv`. Python 3.13.12 available system-wide via deadsnakes PPA. Ruff 0.15.1 available via `uvx ruff`. |
| 2026-02-16 | uv inline script metadata (`# /// script`) is the preferred way to declare dependencies for standalone scripts. No requirements.txt needed. |
| 2026-02-16 | uv automatically manages venvs, lockfiles, and Python versions per-project. Just use `uv init`, `uv add`, `uv run`. |
| 2026-02-16 | `bootstrap.py` at repo root sets up a fresh machine from scratch. Uses stdlib only (no deps) since it runs before uv exists. Installs uv, Python, Ruff, then runs all `utilities/setup-*.py` scripts. Idempotent. |
| 2026-02-16 | AlpineJS dropped from stack. HTMX + vanilla JS (when absolutely needed) covers all client-side interactivity. No JS frameworks at all. |
| 2026-02-16 | Stack hardened: Pyright for type checking (strict mode), structlog for structured logging, session-based auth (no JWT), Dramatiq + Redis for background jobs, FastAPI middleware suite (CORS, TrustedHost, GZip, request IDs, rate limiting, sessions). |

## Notes

*(Running notes, reminders, and context.)*

- **Domain:** `scrybase.app` -- owned by Stephen, DNS managed on Cloudflare with full control.
- **Version philosophy:** Always latest. Python, uv, Ruff, FastAPI, and all dependencies should be the newest stable. No pinning to old versions "for safety." Bleeding edge is the default.
- **uv is king.** If uv can do it, use uv. No pip, no pipx, no poetry, no conda. Ever.
- **Ruff is law.** All Python code is linted and formatted by Ruff before commit. No exceptions.
- **Repo URL:** `git@github.com:dunamismax/Claude.git` (SSH, GitHub, user: dunamismax)
- **Git auth:** SSH key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`). Remote uses SSH, not HTTPS.
