# Awesome Lists

> Curated resource lists. Low effort, high visibility, ecosystem presence.

---

## The Play

Awesome lists are one of the highest star-to-effort ratios on GitHub. They require no code, just good taste and consistent curation. They get you known in a community, they attract PRs from other people (free content), and they show up in Google results for "[topic] resources."

The strategy: own two or three lists in spaces where Stephen has genuine expertise and opinions.

## Target Lists

### awesome-bun

Curated list of Bun packages, tools, resources, and examples. Bun's ecosystem is young enough that a well-maintained list would become canonical quickly.

- Repo name: `awesome-bun`
- Audience: Bun adopters, JavaScript/TypeScript developers evaluating Bun
- Competition: A few exist but none are comprehensive or well-maintained
- Star potential: Very high. `awesome-node` has 57k+ stars. Bun is the hot runtime.

### awesome-self-hosted-typescript

TypeScript-first self-hosted applications and tools. Bridges the self-hosting community with the TypeScript ecosystem.

- Repo name: `awesome-self-hosted-typescript`
- Audience: r/selfhosted + TypeScript developers
- Competition: `awesome-selfhosted` exists (180k+ stars) but isn't language-filtered
- Star potential: Medium-high. Niche crossover with two large communities.

### awesome-better-auth

Resources, starters, plugins, and examples for Better Auth. Positions Stephen as a Better Auth ecosystem leader.

- Repo name: `awesome-better-auth`
- Audience: Better Auth adopters
- Competition: None exists yet
- Star potential: Grows with Better Auth adoption. Early-mover lock-in.

## Execution

1. Pick the highest-impact list first (probably `awesome-bun`)
2. Seed with 30-50 high-quality entries — no padding, no filler
3. Follow the [awesome list guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) for inclusion in the main awesome list
4. Submit to `sindresorhus/awesome` for official listing
5. Set up a CONTRIBUTING.md to attract community PRs
6. Maintain weekly — merge good PRs fast, reject low-quality ones

## Priority

Tier 2. Low effort, steady returns. Start one alongside a Tier 1 build.
