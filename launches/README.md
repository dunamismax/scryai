# launches/

> GitHub visibility plays. Each file is a launch candidate designed to build dunamismax's presence.

Distinct from `PROJECT_IDEAS.md` (personal tooling). These are built to ship publicly, attract stars, and establish ecosystem presence.

## Tier 1 — Build First

| File | Project | Why It Wins |
|---|---|---|
| [bun-self-host-toolkit.md](bun-self-host-toolkit.md) | Bun-native self-hosting toolkit | Bun tooling gap + self-hosting passion |
| [ts-workstation-bootstrap.md](ts-workstation-bootstrap.md) | TypeScript dotfiles/bootstrap tool | Proven category (chezmoi 13k+), TS-native niche |
| [better-auth-kit.md](better-auth-kit.md) | Better Auth production starter | First mover in growing ecosystem |

## Tier 2 — Steady Growth

| File | Project | Why It Wins |
|---|---|---|
| [awesome-lists.md](awesome-lists.md) | Curated awesome-* lists | Highest star-to-effort ratio on GitHub |
| [blog-driven-repos.md](blog-driven-repos.md) | Technical posts + companion repos | Force multiplier for Tier 1 launches |
| [shadcn-component-packs.md](shadcn-component-packs.md) | shadcn/ui extension components | 85k+ star ecosystem, hungry for extensions |

## Execution Order

1. Pick one Tier 1 project. Ship v0.1 in a weekend.
2. Start one awesome list alongside it (low effort, parallel track).
3. Write the companion blog post for the Tier 1 launch.
4. Launch all three (repo + list + post) on the same day.
5. Repeat with next Tier 1 project.
