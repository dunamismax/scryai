# Docs

This directory is reserved for durable, repo-local operational documentation for `scryai`.

Performance and Lighthouse documentation now live with each product repository (`~/github/astro-web-template` and `~/github/astro-blog-template`) so quality gates stay coupled to app code.

Stack refresh decisions:

- `tech-stack-refresh-2026-02-17.md` - Node 24 LTS, PostgreSQL 18, Astro 6 pilot lane posture, and SeaweedFS storage baseline migration.
